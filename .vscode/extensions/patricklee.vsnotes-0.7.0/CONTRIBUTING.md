# Contributing to VS Notes

Contributions and bug fixes are welcome.

How you can contribute:
- Report bugs
- Fix bugs and resolve issues
- Work on features
- Help build tests

## Reporting bugs

Bugs are pesky and if you find one, please open up a new [issue](https://github.com/patleeman/VSNotes/issues) with as much information as you can give us. The more detailed and reproducable the information the easier it is for us to fix the problem.

## Fixing bugs

Want to help fix some bugs? Fork the repository, create a feature branch, then submit a pull request. We'll work it out there.

## Working on features

Have a feature you're interested in contributing? Open an issue and lets talk.

## Build tests

If you like building tests, hop on in there.

# Not covered?
If you're interested in contributing but not sure how, open a new [issue](https://github.com/patleeman/VSNotes/issues).
