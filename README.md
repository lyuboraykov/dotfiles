dotfiles
========

These are my primary configuration files.

## zshrc
I use oh-my-zsh as my primary shell and have made a custom theme, that displays the message from the last git commit.
.zshrc is mostly standart.

### lraykov.theme

![lraykov.theme](http://i58.tinypic.com/2z57wh4.jpg "lraykov.theme")

## bash
I used liquidprompt before switching to zsh, so these are for backup.
